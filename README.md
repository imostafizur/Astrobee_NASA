About Astrobee:
Astrobee, NASAâ€™s new free-flying robotic system, will help astronauts reduce time they spend on routine duties, leaving them to focus more on the things that only humans can do. Working autonomously or via remote control by astronauts, flight controllers or researchers on the ground, the robots are designed to complete tasks such as taking inventory,

Kibo-RPC(Kibo Robot Programming Challenge):
The Kibo Robot Programming Challenge (Kibo-RPC) is an educational program in which
